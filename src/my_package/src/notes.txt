The parameters give by the bag are few parameters like ang_min, ang_max. They give us the polar coordinates in the array of distances.
You have few notes on the slide excercise.
To work with the data from the bag file you have to do the following:
	cd in the folder of your bag file, and check with ls if it is there.
	roscore, it's a must
	rosbag info [bag_name],i.e., rosbag info bag_es_5.bag. It is important to see the list of the topics, in our case /scan and /tf
	to play it in loop we do: rosbag play bag_es_5.bag -l --pause. We should be able to see the duration of the bag, so that we do not have to keep playing it every time
	If now i press the space bar i can see my bag playing.
	While running the core and the bag(remember to play it with loop):
		in a new window use rostopic list to see if /scan and /tf are running
		rostopic hz /scan Will show us how fast the data are moving
		to display the data we can use rostopic echo /scan or /tf(not useful for now)
		we can use rviz:
			we need to configure: fix the reference system. Go to bottom left, click to add and choose the type of topic we want to display or the specific topic. (You should be able to see something in the workspace now).

Suggestions:
Assume peoples have two legs(each leg has to be a set of point with this size, legs are at this distance).
Assume you dont have a person with one leg.
